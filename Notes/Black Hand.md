- No paste mode: Don’t ask for full files.
- Hint mode only: Ask for pseudocode, checklist, or function signature.
- Explain mode: For any code you write, ask AI to quiz you on it.
- One concept at a time: C pointers, then arrays, then structs, etc.
- Small wins daily: 30–90 min, one concrete output.


1. Pick one tiny task (example: “toggle one setting in memory”).
2. You write it first.
3. Compile and run.
4. Ask AI only:
   - “What bug patterns should I check?”
   - “Ask me 5 questions about this code.”
   - “Give me one refactor idea.”
5. Write a 5-line dev note:
   - what I built
   - what confused me
   - what I now understand
   - one next step
   - one question for tomorrow
