## 🧠 Phase 1 — Foundations (6–8 months)

### 1️⃣ Discrete Math (Start Here)

📘 Discrete Mathematics with Applications

Why:

- Explains concepts clearly
    
- Lots of examples
    
- Many practice problems
    
- Solutions available
    

This builds proof thinking + logic (core for software).

---

### 2️⃣ Linear Algebra

📘 Introduction to Linear Algebra

Best for:

- Concept explanation
    
- Real engineering examples
    
- Intuition first, theory second
    

Practice heavily.

If you want extra problems:  
📘 Schaum's Outline of Linear Algebra

(Problem-heavy, great for drill.)

---

### 3️⃣ Probability

📘 Introduction to Probability

Best balance of:

- Clear explanations
    
- Worked examples
    
- Practice problems
    
- Solutions
    

This strengthens thinking under uncertainty.

---

## 🧮 Phase 2 — Bridge to Engineering

After foundations:

### Algorithms

📘 Algorithm Design

Very example-driven.  
Builds mathematical reasoning for software.

---

### Numerical Methods (Very Practical)

📘 Numerical Methods for Engineers

Good for:

- Understanding computation limits
    
- Floating point
    
- Approximation
    
- Embedded relevance

## 🔁 Weekly Method (Your Style)

For each chapter:

1. Read concept section
    
2. Study worked examples
    
3. Close book
    
4. Solve 15–20 problems
    
5. Check solutions
    
6. Redo wrong ones
    

No passive reading.

## 🎯 If You Only Buy 3 Books

1. Epp (Discrete)
    
2. Strang (Linear Algebra)
    
3. Blitzstein (Probability)
    

That’s a serious foundation.
